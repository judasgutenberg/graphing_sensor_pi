I added some glue code (in index.php and with new files backend.php and js/reporting_utilities.js) to the Adafruit Raspberry Pi pan/tilt example ( https://learn.adafruit.com/mini-pan-tilt-kit-assembly )
to provide live plotting from sensors using ChartJS (included in the vendor directory).  
Update ChartJS in the vendor directory with the latest version if you are so inclined.
